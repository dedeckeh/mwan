mwan - Multiwan scripts supporting policy based traffic forwarding

** Abstract **

mwan is a set of scripts triggered by interface hotplug events supporting
policy based routing for both local sourced and forwarded traffic flows.

** Features **

Multiwan package provides an UCI configuration interface that abstracts
iptables and ip rule systems to provide a simplified configuration model
that fits for policy based routing.

UCI Multiwan maps interfaces into policies; the configured interface
identifies the rt_table parameter in the UCI network section which
specifies the routing table to be used. Triggered by interface hotplug
events a rule will be inserted in the routing policy database by means
of the iproute2 utility for each policy.

UCI Multiwan identifies traffic flows by means of rule and host sections.

An UCI rule section contains traffic parameters and a reference to a policy.
Traffic rules will translate into iptables rules in the mangle table; meaning
a mark will be applied on the packet.

An UCI host section contains an absolute appplication path and a reference to
a policy. Host sections translate into a database file which is inspected by a
preloader utility which wraps the socket call. In case of application match a
mark is set via the socket mark option in the preloader utility.

Based on the packet mark a routing table will be selected; depending on the
traffic destination and the rules in the routing table the outgoing physical
interface will be selected.

** OpenWRT firmware integration **

Multiwan can be integrated in OpenWRT as a package. The Makefile currenly puts
under "Network" and the submenu "IP Addresses and Names" when doing make menuconfig.

** Configuration **

mwan uses /etc/config/mwan as UCI configuration file and requires by default
a globals section
